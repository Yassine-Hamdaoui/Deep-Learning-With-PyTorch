# Deep-Learning-With-PyTorch

Deep Learning with PyTorch teaches you how to implement deep learning algorithms with Python and PyTorch. 
This book takes you into a fascinating case study: building an algorithm capable of detecting malignant lung tumors using CT scans. 
As the authors guide you through this real example, you'll discover just how effective and fun PyTorch can be.
After a quick introduction to the deep learning landscape, you'll explore the use of pre-trained networks
and start sharpening your skills on working with tensors. You'll find out how to represent the most common types
of data with tensors and how to build and train neural networks from scratch on practical examples, focusing on images and sequences.
